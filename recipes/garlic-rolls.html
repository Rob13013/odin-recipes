    <h2>The perfect complement to any pasta dish</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>220ml/1 cup warm milk whole or skimmed</li>
      <li>1.5 tsp sugar</li>
      <li>7g/1 tbsp active dry yeast</li>
      <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 egg large</li>
      <li>0.5 tsp salt</li>
      <li>400g/3 cups bread flour or all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 egg for brushing</li>
      <li>1 tbsp butter melted</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic</li>
      <li>1 tbsp fresh parsley chopped</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Preparation Method</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a small bowl combine the warm milk, yeast and sugar and let it stand for 5 minutes until you see the yeast bloom. Then add the oil, salt and 1 egg. Mix with a fork.</li>
    <li>Add the liquid to the flour, mix until rough dough forms, then take it out of the bowl onto a floured surface and start kneading until smooth and elastic dough is formed for approximately 8-10 minutes. If using a stand mixer, knead using a dough hook attachment for 1 minute on low speed, then switch to medium and kneed for 4 minutes longer.</li>
    <li>Take the dough out of the bowl and rub the bowl with vegetable oil, then return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a towel and let it rise for 1 hour to 1.5 hours in a warm place until it triples in volume. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F.</li>
    <li>Take the dough out of the bowl onto a floured surface and divide into 16 equal parts. (You might want to weigh them to ensure they are all the same but eyeballing is also fine.) Roll into balls and place into a well-buttered 9x13 inch baking pan 1 inch apart from each other. Cover with a tea towel and let them rise one more time for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Brush with a beaten egg and bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden. Meanwhile melt 1 tbsp of butter together with pressed garlic, then add fresh chopped parsley to the mix.</li>
    <li>Once the rolls are done, brush them with the garlic butter mixture</li>
</ol>
